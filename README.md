This project involves creating a basic replica of the UI design from the nkindia.in website using HTML and CSS. This endeavor serves as a practical exercise to reinforce skills in front-end web development. By replicating the UI elements, such as layout, styling, and interactive components, learners gain hands-on experience in coding HTML and CSS while understanding the structure and design principles of a real-world website.
